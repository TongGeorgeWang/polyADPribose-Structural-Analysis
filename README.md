Description of each folder:
EnsembleOptimizationMethod: EOM analysis to determine an ensemble of conformers that agrees with experimental small-angle scattering data 
OrderParameters: computation of orientational correlation function, tortuosity (chain twist), and number of base stacking events in a structural ensemble
HierarchicalClustering: dividing structural ensembles into ~3 distinct categories based on size parameters
ClassAveraging_SpectralClustering: class averaging of disordered structural ensembles (identifying a handful of characteristic conformations) using graph theory and spectral clustering.

Each folder has an accompanying example dataset featuring 15mer poly(ADP-ribose) in 100mM NaCl. 
Separate, more detailed README files are provided in each folder where appropriate.
